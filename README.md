# Datacamp-Toyota-Analysis

The following is a sample question in the Data Analyst Professional certification exam at DataCamp. With the use of Python, I successfully solved the question by implementing the approach outlined in the letter below. 

Hi,

Thanks for the previous work you did for us, it was really helpful and the recommendations have really improved our way of working. After that success, I have a new project for your team!
I am sure you have heard that by 2030 we are only going to be able to sell Electric vehicles here in the UK. We want to run some campaigns to promote used Electric cars. We know that in the last year we havenâ€™t sold any electric cars, so we want to know about hybrids to give us some ideas. We want to know anything you can tell us about how the sales differ between hybrid and other types from sales over the last six months. We know that there are less hybrid cars for sale. We think they are more expensive, so we need to make them more appealing. We think hybrid could be a good way to get buyers to think about more environmentally friendly cars.

Our goal is to increase the number of sales of hybrid and electric cars next year.

We want to get moving on this campaign as soon as possible to beat our competitors so the sooner you can share some insights the better.
